# Small Python game that uses a controller input

It was a project to test controller inputs with python.

You have to collect coins to get points.

You have 60 seconds.

Coins give different points based on their size and time they stay on the screen.

Before a coin will disappear it will turn orange and then red.

Coins appear randomly on the field.

You have a booster button that will make you go faster (B) and an ability button that makes you bigger while holding down (A).

Try to collect as many coins as possible!

My Highscore is 2008 points with 39 Coins.

Scores will be saved as .csv

The application is only tested with a wireless xbox one controller.
